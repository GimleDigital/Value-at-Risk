# Value-at-Risk
Proposed solutions to selected exercises in the book "Value-at-Risk: Theory and
Practice" (2nd edition) by Glyn A. Holton.

<<< WORK IN PROGRESS >>>

This is a collection of examples, aimed at showing how selected exercises from
the book "Value at Risk - Theory and Practice" (2nd edition) by Glyn A. Holton
might be resolved by programming in the Scala language and with Apache Spark.
Also, the Breeze library is used for algebra and basic statistics.

The repository is structured in the same way as the book, which is available
online at https://www.value-at-risk.net/

Each proposed exercise solution is a separate Scala program. Navegate to its
directory (for example "chapter01"), start sbt and run the app. If the chapter
contains more than one exercise, sbt will show a list of exercises to choose
from.
