# Value-at-Risk
Proposed solutions to selected exercises in the book "Value-at-Risk: Theory and
Practice" (2nd edition) by Glyn A. Holton.

<<< WORK IN PROGRESS >>>

This is a collection of examples, aimed at showing how selected exercises from
the book "Value at Risk - Theory and Practice" (2nd edition) by Glyn A. Holton
can be resolved by programming in the Scala language and with Apache Spark.
Also, the Breeze library is used for algebra and basic statistics.

The repository is structured in the same way as the book, which is available
online at https://www.value-at-risk.net/

  Chapter 01: Value-at-Risk
  
  Chapter 02: Mathematical Preliminaries <<< TBA >>>
  
  Chapter 03: Probabilities <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 04: Statistics and Time Series <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 05: Monte Carlo Method <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 06: Historical Market Data <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 07: Inference <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 08: Primary Portfolio Mappings <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 09: Portfolio Remappings <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 10: Transformation Procedures <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 11: Historical Simulation <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 12: Implementing Value-at-Risk <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 13: Model Risk, Testing and Valdation <<< TBA >>>

  Chapter 14: Backtesting <<< TBA >>>

Each proposed exercise solution is a separate Scala application. Navegate to its
directory (for example "chapter01"), start sbt and run the app. If the chapter
contains more than one exercise, sbt will show a list of exercises to choose
from.
