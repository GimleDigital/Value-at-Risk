# Value-at-Risk
Proposed solutions to selected exercises in the book "Value-at-Risk: Theory and
Practice" (2nd edition) by Glyn A. Holton.

This is a collection of examples, aimed at showing how selected exercises from
the book "Value at Risk - Theory and Practice" (2nd edition) by Glyn A. Holton
can be resolved by programming in the Scala language and with Apache Spark.
Also, the Breeze library is used for algebra and basic statistics.

The repository is structured in the same way as the book, which is available
online at https://www.value-at-risk.net/

  Chapter 01: Value-at-Risk
  
  Chapter 02: Mathematical Preliminaries
  
  Chapter 03: Probabilities

  Chapter 04: Statistics and Time Series

  Chapter 05: Monte Carlo Method

  Chapter 06: Historical Market Data

  Chapter 07: Inference

  Chapter 08: Primary Portfolio Mappings

  Chapter 09: Portfolio Remappings

  Chapter 10: Transformation Procedures

  Chapter 11: Historical Simulation

  Chapter 12: Implementing Value-at-Risk

  Chapter 13: Model Risk, Testing and Valdation

  Chapter 14: Backtesting

Each proposed exercise solution is a separate Scala application. Navegate to its
directory (for example "chapter01"), start sbt and run the app. If the chapter
contains more than one exercise, sbt will show a list of exercises to choose
from.
